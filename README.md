TASK 10: Exception Handling &amp; Custom Exceptions

# Exception Handling & Custom Exceptions in Java

## Project Description

This project is a simple Java console-based application that demonstrates the use of exception handling and custom exceptions. It is designed for beginners to understand how different types of errors can be handled in a safe and structured manner.

The application accepts student marks as input, validates them using a custom exception, and performs a basic division operation. It uses try-catch-finally blocks to manage runtime errors such as invalid input, divide-by-zero, and out-of-range values.

This project helps students learn how to create robust, error-resistant programs using Java’s exception handling mechanism.
